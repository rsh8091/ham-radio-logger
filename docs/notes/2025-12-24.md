# 2025-12-24 — HamQTH API groundwork & testing setup

## Summary
Today focused on stabilizing the project and recovering lost context after chat/session issues. We successfully resumed development by anchoring progress in git history and project artifacts instead of chat memory.

The main technical work was setting up pytest on Windows, writing the first unit tests, and refactoring credential handling in the HamQTH API module.

---

## What We Accomplished

### Project structure & stability
- Confirmed current layout intentionally avoids `src/` for now
- Added `RUNBOOK.md` to persist architectural decisions and workflow
- Established a habit of small commits + documentation to avoid losing context again

### Testing infrastructure
- Installed and configured `pytest` inside the existing virtual environment
- Created `tests/` directory with:
  - `test_hamqth_api.py`
  - `conftest.py` to ensure repo root is on `sys.path`
- Added `pytest.ini` to restrict test discovery to `tests/test_*.py`
  - Prevents pytest from attempting to collect `.txt` files (Windows edge case)

### Unit testing
- Wrote full unit test coverage for `_load_credentials()`:
  - success case
  - missing username
  - missing password
  - blank / whitespace values
- Tests isolate environment variables using `monkeypatch`
- All tests passing reliably on Windows

### Refactoring
- Removed hard-coded HamQTH credentials from source code
- Replaced with environment variable name constants
- Refactor protected by existing tests (no behavior change)

## Problems Encountered (and Solved)

- **Pytest import errors on Windows**
  - Root cause: repo root not on `sys.path`
  - Fix: `tests/conftest.py`

- **UnicodeDecodeError during pytest collection**
  - Root cause: pytest trying to collect a UTF-16 `tests.txt` file
  - Fix: delete/move file + lock discovery via `pytest.ini`

- **Confusion around stdout vs redirected output**
  - Clarified PowerShell encoding behavior and pytest verbosity

These are all documented so future sessions don’t repeat them.

## Current State

- `hamqth_api.py`
  - `_load_credentials()` implemented, tested, and refactored
  - Other helpers stubbed with TODOs
- Pytest fully operational on Windows
- Runbook established as source of truth

---

## Next Steps

- Write tests for:
  - `_is_session_error()`
  - `_is_not_found_error()`
- Design session handling flow:
  - `_get_session_id()`
  - `_login_and_create_session()`
- Add HTTP helper with timeout + error handling
- Continue API integration one function at a time

## Notes for Future Me

If chat history disappears again:
1. Read `RUNBOOK.md`
2. Check `git log`
3. Resume from “Next Steps”

The repo now contains all necessary context.
